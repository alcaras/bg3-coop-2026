# Minthara Leveling Reference - Dark Knight Sorcadin

**Final Build:** 7 Oathbreaker Paladin / 5 White Draconic Sorcerer
**Gear Priority:** #4 (lowest -- takes what's left after Visara, Shadowheart, Astarion)
**Role:** Melee tank/support. Aura of Protection is the #1 reason she's in the party.
**Starting Stats (respec):** 8 STR, 10 DEX, 14 CON, 8 INT, 10 WIS, 16 CHA

---

## Respec Plan

Minthara joins permanently in Act 2 at Moonrise Towers (level ~7-8). **Immediately respec her.**

Respec order: Paladin 1 -> Paladin 7 (break Oath) -> Sorcerer 1-5.

STR is 8 because she uses **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** (21 STR) until Act 3, then **Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength** (23 STR). Never invest points in STR.

Alternative stat spread: 8 STR, **16 DEX**, 14 CON, 8 INT, 8 WIS, 16 CHA -- better initiative and AC if you want it. DEX doesn't affect attack/damage (elixir/gauntlets handle STR).

---

## Level-by-Level Progression

### Level 1 -- Paladin 1
- **Proficiencies:** Heavy Armor, Martial Weapons, Shields
- **Spells:** Command, Bless
- Starting Paladin gives the armor/weapon proficiencies the build needs.

### Level 2 -- Paladin 2
- **Features:** Divine Smite, Fighting Style: **Great Weapon Fighting**
- **Spells:** Divine Favor, Shield of Faith
- GWF rerolls 1s and 2s on weapon damage dice. Divine Smite is online but conserve spell slots.

### Level 3 -- Paladin 3 (any Oath)
- **Oath:** Doesn't matter (you break it at Level 7). Vengeance gives Hold Person and Misty Step as Oath spells, which is convenient.
- **Spells:** Oath spells (auto-prepared)
- Oath subclass features will be replaced by Oathbreaker at Level 7.

### Level 4 -- Paladin 4
- **Feat:** Great Weapon Master
- Essential damage feat. The -5/+10 toggle (All-In) is worth it with 21 STR from elixir + Bless. Bonus action attack on kill/crit.

### Level 5 -- Paladin 5
- **Features:** Extra Attack
- **Spells:** Level 2 Paladin spells
- Core martial breakpoint. Two attacks per action.

### Level 6 -- Paladin 6
- **Features:** Aura of Protection
- **MAJOR BREAKPOINT.** All allies within 3m/10ft add Minthara's CHA modifier (+3) to ALL saving throws. This is the single strongest party support ability in the game. Stay near your team.

### Level 7 -- Paladin 7 -> BREAK OATH -> Oathbreaker
- **How to break Oath:** Kill an innocent NPC, betray an ally, or commit a sufficiently dark act. If it doesn't trigger naturally, kill a random civilian.
- **Features:** Aura of Hate, Spooky Undead (raise dead action)
- **Oathbreaker Spells:** Hellish Rebuke, Inflict Wounds (auto-prepared)
- Aura of Hate adds CHA modifier to Minthara's own melee weapon damage. See clarification below.

---

### IMPORTANT: Aura of Hate Clarification

Aura of Hate adds Minthara's CHA modifier (+3, later +4) to **her own melee weapon damage only**. It does NOT buff Shadowheart, Visara, Astarion, or any humanoid party member. The only other creatures that benefit are **fiends and undead** within the aura -- including enemy ones, so be careful around undead fights.

The real party-wide benefit is **Aura of Protection** (Level 6), not Aura of Hate.

---

### Level 8 -- Sorcerer 1 (White Draconic)
- **Subclass:** White Draconic Bloodline
- **Features:** Draconic Resilience (bonus HP), cold damage bonus on cold spells
- **Cantrips:** Friends, Ray of Frost, plus 2 others of choice
- **Spells:** Shield, Armour of Agathys
- Shield (+5 AC reaction) is mandatory. Armour of Agathys gives temp HP and cold retaliation damage -- boosted by White Draconic (+CHA mod to cold damage).

### Level 9 -- Sorcerer 2
- **Features:** Metamagic: **Extended Spell**, **Twinned Spell**
- **Spell:** Misty Step or Mirror Image
- Extended Spell doubles duration on Command (2 turns) or Hold Person. Twinned Spell lets you Haste two allies at once (once you get Haste).

### Level 10 -- Sorcerer 3
- **Features:** Metamagic: **Quickened Spell**
- **Spell:** Hold Person (if not already from Oath), or Haste
- Quickened Spell lets you cast a spell as a bonus action (3 Sorcery Points). This is how you cast Command + Multiattack in one turn since you do NOT have Band of the Mystic Scoundrel (that goes to Shadowheart).

### Level 11 -- Sorcerer 4
- **Feat:** +2 CHA (CHA now 18)
- **Spell:** Counterspell
- CHA 18 improves: Aura of Protection (+4 saves), Aura of Hate (+4 melee damage), spell save DC, and spell attack rolls. Multi-stat value.

### Level 12 -- Sorcerer 5
- **Features:** Level 3 Sorcerer spells, Level 4 spell slots
- **Spell:** Hypnotic Pattern or Haste (whichever not taken earlier)
- **BUILD COMPLETE: 7 Oathbreaker / 5 White Draconic Sorcerer.**

---

## Spell Selection

### Always Prepared (Core)
- **Command** (Paladin) -- Command: Approach groups enemies. Command: Grovel makes them prone. Use Extended Spell for 2-turn duration or Quickened to cast as bonus action.
- **Bless** (Paladin) -- +1d4 to attack rolls and saving throws for 3 allies. Use when not concentrating on something better.
- **Shield** (Sorcerer) -- Reaction, +5 AC until next turn. Never leave home without it.
- **Armour of Agathys** (Sorcerer) -- NOT concentration. Cast at highest slot for massive temp HP + cold retaliation damage (boosted by White Draconic).
- **Counterspell** (Sorcerer 5) -- Reaction spell denial. Essential in Act 3.

### Concentration Options (pick one per fight)
- **Hold Person** -- Auto-crit setup on humanoids. Upcast for multiple targets.
- **Haste** (Twinned on self + ally) -- Extra action, +2 AC, double movement. Costs 6 Sorcery Points to Twin.
- **Hypnotic Pattern** -- AoE crowd control. Does not stack with Hold Person (both concentration).

### Utility / Flex
- Misty Step -- Bonus action teleport. Repositioning for aura coverage.
- Mirror Image -- Not concentration. Extra survivability layer.
- Healing Word (if no one else has it) -- Bonus action emergency pickup.

## BiS Gear (No Conflicts)

Minthara does NOT get: Shar's Spear (Shadowheart), Bhaalist Armour (Shadowheart), Hat of Fire Acuity (Visara), Markoheshkir (Visara), Band of the Mystic Scoundrel (Shadowheart).

| Slot | Item | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| Main Hand | Balduran's Giantslayer | Act 3 -- Wyrm's Rock (Ansur dragon fight) |
| Ranged | Vicious Shortbow | Act 3 -- Lower City vendor |
| Head | Helm of Balduran | Act 3 -- Wyrm's Rock (same fight as Giantslayer) |
| Chest | Helldusk Armour | Act 3 -- House of Hope (Raphael fight) |
| Gloves | Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength | Act 3 -- House of Hope archives |
| Boots | Helldusk Boots | Act 3 -- House of Hope |
| Cloak | Cloak of Displacement | Act 3 -- Lower City vendor |
| Amulet | Amulet of Greater Health (23 CON) | Act 3 -- House of Hope archives |
| Ring 1 | Killer's Sweetheart | Act 2 -- Gauntlet of Shar |
| Ring 2 | Ring of Protection | Act 1 -- Emerald Grove (Mol's quest) |

**House of Hope is Minthara's gearing event.** Helldusk Armour, Helldusk Boots, Gauntlets, and Amulet all drop from one trip. Plan accordingly.

---

## Gear Progression

**Act 2 (joins):**
Transfer Lae'zel's gear -- Adamantine Splint Armour, Everburn Blade or any +1/+2 greatsword. Ring of Protection (from Act 1). Begin using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength daily.

**Act 2 (Gauntlet of Shar):**
Killer's Sweetheart (auto-crit ring, 1/long rest). Keep Adamantine Splint + greatsword.

**Act 3 (House of Hope):**
Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength + Amulet of Greater Health + Helldusk Armour + Helldusk Boots. All from one trip. Switch daily elixir from Hill Giant Strength to **Elixir of Bloodlust** (extra action on kill).

**Act 3 (Wyrm's Rock -- Ansur fight):**
Balduran's Giantslayer + Helm of Balduran. Both from the same dragon fight. Giantslayer replaces greatsword. Full build online.

---

## Consumables

| Consumable | When | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Elixir of Hill Giant Strength | Act 2 until Gauntlets | Sets STR to 21. Daily elixir. |
| Elixir of Bloodlust | Act 3 after Gauntlets | Extra action on kill. Switch to this once STR is handled by gear. |
| Armour of Agathys | Every fight | Cast pre-combat. NOT an elixir -- it's a spell. Temp HP + cold retaliation. |

---

## Combat Loop

Minthara does NOT have Band of the Mystic Scoundrel (goes to Shadowheart). She cannot cast Command as a bonus action for free. This changes her action economy.

### Standard Turn Options

**Default Damage Turn:**
Action: Multiattack (2 hits + possible GWM bonus action attack on kill/crit). Smite on crits or kills.

**Control Turn (Quickened):**
Bonus Action: Quickened Command: Approach/Grovel (3 Sorcery Points). Action: Multiattack. Best when enemies need grouping or prone-ing.

**Control Turn (Extended, 2-turn setup):**
Turn 1 Action: Extended Command (lasts 2 turns). Turn 2 Action: Multiattack into grouped/prone enemies.

**Burst Turn (Hold Person setup):**
Action: Hold Person (or already active). Next turn or ally turn: Multiattack + Divine Smite on held target (auto-crit within 1.5m).

**Buff/Setup Turn:**
Action: Multiattack. Bonus Action: Quickened Armour of Agathys, or pre-combat Twinned Haste (self + ally).

### Sorcery Point Budget
- Quickened Spell: 3 points
- Twinned Haste: 6 points (Level 3 spell)
- Extended Command: 1 point
- Total Sorcery Points at Sorcerer 5: 5 points
- Convert spell slots to Sorcery Points when needed (bonus action)

## Key Mechanics

**Aura of Protection:**
+4 to ALL saving throws for all allies within 3m/10ft (at 18 CHA). This is always active, no concentration. Position Minthara in the center of the party. This single feature prevents more party wipes than any other ability in the game.

**Balduran's Giantslayer:**
Doubles STR modifier on damage rolls. With 23 STR (+6 modifier), each hit adds +12 from STR instead of +6. Also grants Giant Form (1/short rest): +1d6 weapon damage, 27 temp HP, advantage on STR checks for 10 turns.

**Armour of Agathys + White Draconic:**
White Draconic Bloodline adds CHA modifier (+4) to cold damage dealt. Armour of Agathys deals cold damage to melee attackers while temp HP lasts. Cast at highest slot (Level 4 = 20 temp HP, 20+4 cold retaliation per hit). This is NOT concentration -- stack it with Hold Person or Haste.

**Divine Smite Priority:**
Smite when: target is Held (auto-crit within melee range), you roll a natural crit, the hit will secure a kill (procs Bloodlust), or it's a boss. Do NOT Smite on normal hits against trash -- conserve slots for Quickened Command and Armour of Agathys.

**Killer's Sweetheart:**
Once per long rest, your next crit is an automatic critical hit. Save it for a big Divine Smite turn against a priority target.

**Helldusk Armour:**
Heavy armor, no STR requirement. Grants fire resistance, Infernal Retribution (burn attackers), and the ability to succeed saving throws 3 times per long rest (Helldusk passive). Stacks with Aura of Protection for near-immunity to save-or-suck effects.

**Helm of Balduran:**
+1 to AC and saving throws. Heals 2 HP at the start of each turn. Prevents critical hits against you. The anti-crit alone makes it best-in-slot.
