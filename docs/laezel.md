# Lae'zel - Temporary Frontline Fighter (Act 1 to Early Act 2)

Lae'zel serves as the party's frontline melee fighter until Minthara permanently joins in Act 2. Once Minthara is available, Lae'zel's gear transfers directly to her and Lae'zel goes to camp.

## Gear Transfer to Minthara

When Minthara permanently joins in Act 2, hand everything over:

- **Adamantine Splint Armour** --> Minthara (she wears this until Helldusk Armour in Act 3)
- **Everburn Blade** --> Minthara (she uses this until better 2H weapons available)
- **Grymskull Helm** --> Minthara (temporary head until Helm of Balduran in Act 3)
- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** --> continues on Minthara
- Lae'zel goes to camp or leaves party

## Combat Tips

- **Action Surge** on hard fights for 4 attacks in one turn (2 base + 2 from Action Surge after level 5).
- **Trip Attack** to knock enemies prone -- gives advantage to all melee allies for the rest of the round.
- **Precision Attack** when GWM's -5 penalty causes misses -- spend a superiority die to add to the roll.
- **Menacing Attack** against dangerous enemies to apply Frightened, preventing them from moving closer.
- **Pre-fight:** activate Elixir of Hill Giant Strength after each long rest. It lasts until the next long rest.
