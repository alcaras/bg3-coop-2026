# Co-Op Coordination

How the two players work together. Positioning, spell coordination, and common mistakes to avoid.
{: .fs-5 }

---

## Player Assignments

| | Player 1 (Melee) | Player 2 (Ranged) |
|---|---|---|
| **Characters** | Shadowheart + Minthara | Varria + Astarion |
| **Positioning** | Center of fight, within Minthara's 3m aura | Behind melee line, high ground when possible |
| **Primary role** | Burst damage + tanking + aura support | AoE damage + crowd control + assassination |
| **Haste source** | Receive Haste from Varria (Twinned) | Varria self-Hastes via Twinned |
| **Counterspell duty** | Backup (Shadowheart or Minthara) | Primary (Varria) |

---

## 3 Positioning Rules

**1. Minthara is the anchor.**
Shadowheart stays within 3m of Minthara at all times. Aura of Protection gives +4 to ALL saving throws. If Shadowheart is NOT near Minthara, she is 4 points worse on every save. This is the difference between passing and failing most save-or-suck effects.

**2. Ranged characters stay behind the melee line.**
Varria and Astarion should never be in melee range. Astarion wants high ground (+1d4 ranged bonus). Varria wants line of sight to enemy groups for Fireball and Scorching Ray.

**3. Warn before Fireball.**
Player 2 should warn Player 1 before Varria casts Fireball near melee characters. Careful Spell protects allies from the save damage, but Player 1 should still know it's coming so they can position optimally. If Varria doesn't have Careful metamagic available, DO NOT Fireball near melee.

---

## Counterspell Priority

Three characters have Counterspell (Varria, Shadowheart, Minthara). Only one should react per enemy spell.

| Situation | Who Counterspells | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Default | **Varria** (Player 2) | Highest spell save DC if contested |
| Varria already used reaction (Shield) | **Shadowheart** (Player 1) | Next highest priority |
| Both already reacted this round | **Minthara** (Player 1) | Last resort |
| Enemy casting near melee only | Shadowheart or Minthara | Closer range, easier to react |

**Rule:** Player 2 Counterspells first. If Varria already Shielded this round, Player 1 takes over.

---

## Concentration Spell Coordination

Only one concentration spell per character. Don't double up on the same spell.

| Character | Default Concentration | Switch to (bosses/special) |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Varria | Haste (Twinned: self + SH or Astarion) | Hold Person/Monster |
| Shadowheart | -- (saves concentration for Hold Person/Monster) | Hunger of Hadar (obscured zone for Shar's Spear) |
| Minthara | Bless (3 allies, +1d4 attacks/saves) | Hold Person, or Twinned Haste if Varria is on Hold duty |

**Key rule:** If Varria is concentrating on Haste, Minthara does NOT also cast Haste. Minthara runs Bless instead. If Varria switches to Hold Monster for a boss, Minthara can pick up Twinned Haste (self + Shadowheart).

> **Do NOT break Varria's Haste concentration.** If Varria drops concentration, both Hasted characters (Varria + ally) lose their next turn entirely. Protect Varria.

---

## Command Coordination

Three characters have Command. They should target different groups.

| Character | Command Role | Method | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Varria** | Largest enemy group | Extended Command (2 turns, 1 SP) | 2 turns — lock 20+ enemies by cycling |
| **Shadowheart** | Enemies near her | Command: Approach (bonus action via Band of Mystic Scoundrel after weapon hit) | 1 turn |
| **Minthara** | Stragglers / flankers | Quickened Command (3 SP) or Extended Command (1 SP) | 1-2 turns |

**Approach vs Grovel:**
- **Command: Approach** — enemies walk toward the caster. Use when you want to GROUP enemies for Slashing Flourish cleave.
- **Command: Grovel** — enemies fall prone. Use when you want to STOP enemies and give melee advantage on attacks.

## Fight Types

### Trash Mobs (most encounters)

| Player 1 | Player 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Shadowheart: Stack Acuity → Command: Approach → Slashing Flourish + Smite | Varria: Quickened Scorching Ray → Fireball the group |
| Minthara: Multiattack + GWM cleanup | Astarion: Snipe priority targets from stealth |

### Boss Fights (single tough enemy)

| Player 1 | Player 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Shadowheart: Command: Grovel (burn Legendary Resistance) → Hold Monster → auto-crit Smites | Varria: Hold Person/Monster → Quickened Scorching Ray into held target |
| Minthara: Multiattack + Strategic Smites on crits | Astarion: Action Surge burst → focus boss |

### Mixed (boss + adds)

| Player 1 | Player 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Shadowheart: Handle the boss (Hold + Smite) | Varria: AoE the adds (Fireball, Extended Command) |
| Minthara: Protect Shadowheart, Bless the party, cleanup adds | Astarion: Kill the boss's support (healers, casters) |

## Common Mistakes

- **Breaking Varria's Haste.** If Varria loses concentration, two characters lose their next turn. Don't let enemies focus Varria. Shield and Counterspell exist for a reason.
- **Sending Astarion into melee.** He has 14 CON, light armor, and zero melee kit. His entire build is ranged. Keep him at distance.
- **Forgetting to toggle Spellmight Gloves off.** Varria's first Scorching Ray of each fight should have Spellmight OFF (building Acuity). Toggle ON only after 7+ stacks.
- **Smiting during Acuity building.** Shadowheart should NOT Smite on her first 2-3 attacks. Those are for stacking Arcane Acuity, not for damage. Smite on the kill turn.
- **Minthara wandering away.** The aura is only 3 meters. If Minthara moves away to chase an enemy, Shadowheart loses +4 to all saves. Minthara's job is to stay put and be the anchor.
- **Double-concentrating on Haste.** If Varria has Twinned Haste up, Minthara should NOT also cast Haste. Use Bless or no concentration.
- **Wasting Astarion's burst on weak enemies.** His surprise round does 150-210 damage. Don't waste it on a goblin with 20 HP. Target the biggest threat.
- **Not using Oil of Accuracy on Shadowheart.** Pre-coat her weapon before fights. This offsets the GWM -5 penalty significantly.
