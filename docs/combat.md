## Varria — Fire Sorlock (Player 2)

**Pre-combat:** Ensure Daylight is active (Callous Glow Ring needs it). Twinned Haste on self + Shadowheart or Astarion.

| Acuity | Action | Bonus Action | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| < 7 | Scorching Ray (highest slot), Spellmight **OFF** | -- | Don't kill target. Build stacks. Each ray = +2 Acuity. |
| 7-10 | Scorching Ray, Spellmight **ON** | -- | +10 from Acuity covers the -5 penalty. |
| 10 | Fireball (Careful if melee nearby) | Quickened Scorching Ray | Max damage turn. |
| 10 | Extended Command: Grovel/Halt | Quickened Scorching Ray | Lock down 2+ groups for 2 turns. |
| Boss | Hold Person/Monster | Quickened Scorching Ray into held target | Held = advantage on spell attacks. |

**Metamagic priority:** Quickened (damage as bonus action) > Extended (2-turn Command) > Careful (protect melee from Fireball) > Twinned (Haste)

**Fire-immune enemies:** Chain Lightning (Level 6 slot). Or Extended Command: Grovel and let melee handle the damage.

**Reactions:** Counterspell (always first priority). Shield (if targeted by attack).

**Heat (Markoheshkir):** Attune to Flame of Wrath. Click Heat Convergence after EVERY fire cast to add Heat damage to next spell. Don't stand in oil.

---

## Shadowheart — Smite Swords Bard (Player 1)

**Pre-combat:** Oil of Accuracy on weapon. Receive Haste from Varria or Minthara.

| Phase | Action | Bonus Action | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1. Stack Acuity | Attack obscured enemy (2 hits). Do NOT use GWM. Do NOT kill. | -- | Each hit = +2 Acuity from Helmet. Get 6-8 stacks. |
| 2. Group enemies | Attack any enemy | Command: Approach (free via Band of Mystic Scoundrel) | All nearby enemies walk to you. Move to obscured spot. |
| 3. Kill turn | Slashing Flourish + Divine Smite | Edge of Darkness (Shar's Spear AoE) or GWM bonus attack | Smite on every confirmed hit. Enemies melt. |

**Bosses with Legendary Resistance:**

| Turn | Action |
|------|--------|
| Turn 1 | Command: Grovel (burns 1 LR charge) |
| Turn 2 | Hold Monster (if LR exhausted) → auto-crit Smites next turn |

**When to Smite:**
- Target is Held (auto-crit in melee)
- Natural crit rolled
- Hit will secure a kill (procs Bloodlust for extra action)
- Boss target

**When NOT to Smite:** Normal hits on trash. Conserve slots for Command and Smites on crits.

**Reactions:** Counterspell (if Varria already used hers). Never waste reaction on trash.

**Obscured check:** Hold Shift to see light level. Shar's Spear gives advantage on saves + 1d6 bonus damage when you or target is obscured.

---

## Astarion — Gloom Stalker Assassin (Player 2)

**Pre-combat:** Separate from party. Pass Without Trace (+10 Stealth for whole party). Use Umbral Shroud or Potion of Invisibility in dim/dark areas.

| Situation | Action | Bonus Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Surprise round | 3 attacks (2 + Dread Ambusher), all auto-crit | War Priest attack (also auto-crit) | Sharpshooter ON. 4 crits. |
| Surprise + Action Surge | +2 more attacks (still auto-crit) | -- | 5-6 total crits. Fight should be over. |
| No surprise (turn 1) | 3 attacks (2 + Dread Ambusher) | Cunning Action: Hide | Dread Ambusher still gives extra attack + 1d8 on turn 1. |
| Later turns | 2 attacks (Sharpshooter if advantage) | Cunning Action: Hide or War Priest attack | Hide → regain advantage for next turn. |

**Target priority:** Spellcasters first > high-threat targets > NOT low-HP fodder (don't waste burst damage on weak enemies).

**Sharpshooter toggle:** ON with advantage or surprise. OFF when below ~70% hit chance. Archery (+2) and high DEX help offset the -5.

**Action Surge:** Recharges on short rest. Use aggressively. Only save it if you expect multiple hard fights before resting.

**High ground:** Always seek it. +1d4 bonus to ranged attacks from elevation advantage.

**STR for Titanstring:** Club of Hill Giant Strength (melee slot, 19 STR) or Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength (27 STR in Act 3). The bow adds full STR modifier to damage.

---

## Minthara — Dark Knight Sorcadin (Player 1)

**Always active:** Aura of Protection (+4 to ALL saves for allies within 3m). **STAY NEAR SHADOWHEART.**
{: .text-red-300 }

**Pre-combat:** Armour of Agathys at highest spell slot. NOT concentration — stacks with everything. Temp HP + cold retaliation damage (boosted by White Draconic +4).

| Turn Type | Action | Bonus Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Default damage | Multiattack (2 hits) | GWM bonus attack (on kill/crit) | Smite on crits/kills only. |
| Group enemies | Extended Command: Approach (2-turn, 1 SP) | -- | Next turn: Multiattack into grouped enemies. |
| Quick control | Multiattack | Quickened Command: Grovel (3 SP) | Prone = advantage for all melee allies. |
| Buff turn | Multiattack | Quickened Armour of Agathys (3 SP) | Refresh temp HP mid-fight. |
| Boss setup | Hold Person/Monster (action) | -- | Next turn: auto-crit Smites in melee range. |
| Support | Twinned Haste (self + ally, 6 SP) | -- | Only if Varria can't provide Haste. |

**Sorcery Points (5 total):**

| Metamagic | Cost | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Extended Spell | 1 SP | 2-turn Command (best value) |
| Quickened Spell | 3 SP | Bonus action Command or Agathys |
| Twinned Haste | 6 SP | Requires converting spell slots (bonus action) |

Convert a Level 2 slot → 2 SP, Level 3 slot → 3 SP when needed.

**When to Smite:** Held targets (auto-crit), natural crits, kill shots (proc Bloodlust). NOT on normal trash hits — conserve slots for Command and Agathys.

**Reactions:** Shield (+5 AC, always take it if hit). Counterspell only if Varria AND Shadowheart already used their reactions.

**Killer's Sweetheart:** Auto-crit once per long rest. Save it for a big Divine Smite turn against a priority target.

## Turn Order & Party Priorities

### Elixir Reminder (apply after every long rest)

|-----------|---------|-------|
| Varria | Elixir of Bloodlust | Elixir of Bloodlust |
| Shadowheart | Elixir of Bloodlust | Elixir of Bloodlust (Vigilance for boss fights) |
| Astarion | Elixir of Bloodlust + Club of Hill Giant STR | Elixir of Cloud Giant STR (27 STR) |
| Minthara | Elixir of Hill Giant STR | Elixir of Bloodlust (after Gauntlets) |

### Quick Toggles Checklist

- [ ] Spellmight Gloves **OFF** on Varria (toggle ON after Acuity 7+)
- [ ] Sharpshooter (All-In) **OFF** on Astarion unless advantage/surprise
- [ ] GWM (All-In) **OFF** on Shadowheart during Acuity building phase
- [ ] Daylight active (Varria — for Callous Glow Ring)
- [ ] Astarion separated and stealthed (for surprise)
