## Surprise Round Burst Sequence

This is the reason you play Assassin. Set it up properly and most fights end in one turn.

1. **Setup:** Approach solo, invisible (Umbral Shroud in darkness or Potion of Invisibility)
2. **Initiate:** Attack from stealth to trigger Surprise
3. **All hits are auto-crits** (Assassinate: Ambush) with **advantage** (Assassinate: Initiative)
4. **First action:** Attack (2 hits from Extra Attack) + Dread Ambusher bonus attack = **3 attacks**
5. **Bonus action:** War Priest attack (another auto-crit) OR Cunning Action: Hide
6. **Action Surge:** 2 more attacks (still auto-crit if target is surprised)
7. **Total: 5-6 attacks, ALL critical hits, each with Sharpshooter +10 damage**
8. **After burst:** Umbral Shroud to go invisible again, or continue fighting normally

### Damage math (Level 12, Cloud Giant Strength)
Per auto-crit Sharpshooter hit: 2d8 (bow crit) + 5 (DEX) + 8 (STR via Titanstring) + 10 (Sharpshooter) + misc = ~31-35 damage per arrow
With 5-6 arrows: **~155-210 damage in one turn**, plus Sneak Attack (applied once).

## Key Mechanics

**Titanstring Bow:** Adds STR modifier to damage on top of normal DEX-based attacks. With Cloud Giant Strength (27 STR), that is +8 damage per hit for free.

**Sharpshooter:** -5 to attack, +10 damage. Offset with Archery (+2), high ground (+1d4), Oil of Accuracy (+2), advantage from stealth/Assassinate. On surprise rounds the -5 barely matters since you have advantage + auto-crit.

**Assassinate:** On surprise rounds, all attacks against surprised creatures are automatic critical hits. Crits double ALL dice (weapon, Sneak Attack, Dread Ambusher, etc.). This is the build's identity.

**Pickpocketing:** Expertise in Sleight of Hand + high DEX makes Astarion the party's primary pickpocket. Steal from merchants freely.

**War Priest:** Gives WIS modifier (3) bonus action attacks per long rest. These are full weapon attacks, not off-hand. They benefit from all damage bonuses.

## Key Breakpoints

| Level | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Gloom Stalker online: Dread Ambusher, +3 initiative, Umbral Shroud |
| 4 | Sharpshooter: +10 damage per hit |
| 5 | Extra Attack: 3 attacks on first turn (2 + Dread Ambusher) |
| 8 | Assassin online: surprise rounds become auto-crit burst turns |
| 11 | Action Surge: 5-6 attacks on surprise turns, all crits |
| 12 | War Cleric: bonus action attacks, Guidance utility, build complete |

## Combat Tips

**Setting up Surprise:** Separate Astarion from the party. Use Pass Without Trace (+10 Stealth) before approaching. Enter stealth, get into position, attack. The rest of the party can join after.

**When Surprise fails:** You still have a strong kit. Extra Attack + Dread Ambusher + Sharpshooter is good damage. Use Cunning Action: Hide to regain advantage for next turn.

**Target priority:** Eliminate spellcasters and high-threat enemies first. The burst damage is wasted on low-HP fodder.

**Positioning:** Always seek high ground for the +1d4 attack bonus. Stay at range. Use Cunning Action: Dash or Disengage if enemies close in.

**Resource pacing:** Action Surge recharges on short rest. Use it aggressively in hard fights, then short rest. War Priest charges are long rest only -- save them for important encounters.
