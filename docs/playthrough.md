<summary>ACT 1 — Levels 1-6</summary>
<div markdown="1">

### Nautiloid (Level 1)
- [ ] **Everburn Blade** → Lae'zel: Kill or Command Commander Zhalk for his greatsword. Best available until Sword of Justice at the Risen Road.
- Free Lae'zel and Shadowheart. Talk to Us (the brain in a jar) — it can become a camp companion.

### Ravaged Beach → Camp (Level 1-2)
- Recruit: Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale (all near the crash site)
- **Dank Crypt:** Explore the ruins north of the beach. Awaken Withers (enables respec). Watch for traps — the sarcophagus room has a scripted undead ambush.
- Recruit Lae'zel nearby (caged by tieflings — talk them down or fight)
- Recruit Scratch the dog on the road near Blighted Village

### Emerald Grove (Level 2-3)
- Recruit Wyll (temporary — lost after grove raid)
- **DO NOT KILL THE STRANGE OX** in the stables. It must survive to Act 2.
- Buy Elixir of Hill Giant Strength from Auntie Ethel's stall (stock up — buy several). **Buy everything from Ethel before entering Sunlit Wetlands — she leaves the grove.**
- Save Arabella from Kagha in the druid sanctum (she dies if you wait)
- [ ] **Broodmother's Revenge** → Astarion: From Kagha in druid sanctum (loot/steal)
- [ ] **Ring of Protection** → Minthara (later): Mol's quest reward (steal the idol)

### Blighted Village (Level 3)
- [ ] **Bracers of Defence** → Varria: Gilded chest in Apothecary's Cellar (X: -656 Y: -370)
- [ ] **Haste Helm** → Lae'zel: Moss-Covered Chest (X: 29 Y: 405)
- [ ] **Necromancy of Thay** → Varria (or anyone): Found in Apothecary's Cellar behind the bookcase. Grants Speak With Dead. **Keep this book** — completing it with the Tharchiate Codex in Act 3 grants Forbidden Knowledge, which bypasses the DC 25 Religion check at the Mirror of Loss.
- **Whispering Depths** (under the well): Phase Spider Matriarch fight. Loot the Dark Amethyst (needed to open Necromancy of Thay).
- Note the **Masterwork Weapon forge** in the village — you'll return later with Sussur Bark from the Underdark to craft a Sussur Dagger for the Hag fight.

### Risen Road / Waukeen's Rest (Level 3-4)

> **TIME-SENSITIVE:** Rescue Counsellor Florrick from the burning inn BEFORE long resting or fast traveling — survivors die in the fire. Also: gnolls kill the Zhentarim couriers (Rugan/Olly) after 1 long rest.

- [ ] **The Spellsparkler** → Varria: Reward for rescuing Counsellor Florrick
- [ ] **Titanstring Bow** → Astarion: Zhentarim trader (Brem in Zhentarim Hideout, behind the stables)
- [ ] **Sword of Justice** → Lae'zel: Kill Anders and his fake paladins at the Risen Road tollhouse. +1 greatsword with Tyr's Protection (+2 AC as bonus action, no concentration competition on a Fighter). **Replaces Everburn Blade.**

### Owlbear Cave (Level 3-4)
- Selunite Gilded Chest inside (read the Prayer Sheet on the ground first or the chest is trapped)
- Spare the owlbear cub — it later appears at the Goblin Camp, then visits your camp over several long rests if you feed it camp supplies

### Goblin Camp (Level 4-5)
- [ ] **Crusher's Ring** → Lae'zel: Novice Crusher near waypoint (+3m movement)
- [ ] **Gloves of Archery** → Astarion: Buy from Grat the Trader (X: -99 Y: 424)
- **Rescue Volo** from the goblin camp courtyard. If you don't rescue him before the goblins move to Moonrise, he vanishes permanently. He later offers a free eye replacement granting **permanent See Invisibility**.
- Talk to Minthara in her war room. **Tell her the Grove's location.**
- Talk to Priestess Gut (tadpole stuff). She lures you to a private room — be ready for a fight or use the tadpole to dominate her.

<details>
<summary><strong>!! PRE-RAID CHECKLIST (do all of this BEFORE raiding)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

These vendors and quests are **permanently lost** after the grove raid:

- [ ] Buy everything from **Dammon** (blacksmith in grove) — he dies in the raid
- [ ] Buy everything from **Arron** (general goods in grove) — he dies in the raid
- [ ] Complete **Mol's quest** (steal the Idol) for Ring of Protection
- [ ] **Save Arabella** from Kagha (if not done already)
- [ ] **Rescue Volo** from Goblin Camp (if not done already)
- [ ] Stock up on **Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength** (Auntie Ethel's stall, if any remain)

**Consequences of the raid:** Wyll leaves permanently. Karlach/Halsin unavailable for the entire game. Gale may leave — **save before the post-raid conversation and pass the Deception/Insight check to keep him.**

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>!! STORY CHOICE: Raid the Emerald Grove (Spoilers)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- Side with goblins, blow the war horn, raid the grove
- **Consequences:** Wyll leaves. Karlach/Halsin unavailable. Gale may leave (pass check to keep).
- Minthara is a temp ally for the fight. She joins PERMANENTLY in Act 2.

</div>
</details>

### Underdark — Myconid Colony (Level 4-5)
Enter via Goblin Camp (jump down from the Selunite temple), Blighted Village well (via Whispering Depths), or the Sunlit Wetlands (via Hag's lair).

- [ ] **Phalar Aluve** → Shadowheart: Lodged in rock west of Ancient Battlefield (X: 116 Y: -192). Use Melody: Sing for party support.
- [ ] **The Shadespell Circlet** → Varria: Buy from Omeluum after quest
- [ ] **Boots of Stormy Clamour** → Varria: Buy from Omeluum after quest
- [ ] **Melf's First Staff** → Varria: Buy from Blurg (X: 111 Y: -89, dual wield with Spellsparkler)
- [ ] **Caustic Band** → Astarion: Buy from Derryth Bonecloak
- Pick up Omeluum's mushroom quest (Sussur Bloom from Underdark + Tongue of Madness from Arcane Tower area)
- Watch for the **Bulette** — it burrows underground and ambushes. Use height advantage.

### Underdark — Arcane Tower (Level 5)
Power it up by placing Sussur Bloom in the generator at the base.

- [ ] **Club of Hill Giant Strength** → Astarion: Break the Stool of Hill Giant Strength on the top floor/roof (X: -26 Y: -272). Sets STR to 19 — lets Astarion drink Elixir of Bloodlust instead of STR elixirs.
- Complete Omeluum's mushroom quest ingredients here (Tongue of Madness grows nearby)
- [ ] Pick up **Sussur Bark** from the Sussur Tree (glowing blue tree SW of Arcane Tower). Bring it back to the Blighted Village forge to craft a **Sussur Dagger** — silences on hit, your best tool for the upcoming Hag fight.

### Sunlit Wetlands / Hag Fight (Level 5)
Do this AFTER the Arcane Tower — the Level 5 power spike (Extra Attack, Level 3 spells) makes this fight much more comfortable, especially for newer players.

- **HAG'S HAIR → SHADOWHEART (+1 STR)**. STR goes from 17→18.
- Save Mayrina (or don't — up to the party). Douse the cage fire with Create Water or an arrow.
- **Tip:** Ethel creates illusory clones of herself during the fight. Equip the **Sussur Dagger** on a party member to silence her on hit — this shuts down her spellcasting. Weapon attacks are safer than spells here.

### Underdark — Grymforge (Level 5-6)

> **TIME-SENSITIVE:** Free True Soul Nere within 1 long rest of arriving at the rubble or he and the trapped gnomes die.

- [ ] **Disintegrating Night Walkers** → Shadowheart: Kill Nere (rally the duergar against him)
- [ ] **Adamantine Splint Armour** → Lae'zel: Craft at Adamantine Forge. Best heavy armor until Helldusk in Act 3.
- [ ] **Adamantine Scale Mail** → Shadowheart: Craft at Adamantine Forge. Crit immunity + damage reduction. Best medium armor until her respec gives heavy armor proficiency.
- [ ] **Grymskull Helm** → Lae'zel: Loot from Grym boss (fire damage is its weakness — use lava vents)
- [ ] **The Protecty Sparkswall** → Varria: Gilded chest at end of trapped bridge (X: -645 Y: 360)
- Save Barcus Wroot and the gnome prisoners (Barcus becomes a camp merchant later)
- Return Nere's head to Myconid Colony for reward

> **Adamantine Forge:** Only 2 Mithril Ore in the entire game. Craft **Splint Armour + Scale Mail**. Skip the Shield — nobody in this party uses one (all melee characters use Great Weapon Master with two-handed weapons). Skip the weapons — they're outclassed by what you already have.

### Mountain Pass / Creche Y'llek (Level 5-6)
The Githyanki Creche has excellent vendor gear plus a major story confrontation with the Inquisitor.

- [ ] **Gloves of Dexterity** → Shadowheart: Buy from A'jak'nir Jeera (X: 1380 Y: -798). NEVER REMOVE. Sets DEX to 18.
- [ ] **Unseen Menace** → Shadowheart: Buy from A'jak'nir Jeera (same trader).
- [ ] **Knife of the Undermountain King** → Astarion: Buy from A'jak'nir Jeera (same trader).
- [ ] **Strange Conduit Ring** → Astarion: Elegant chest in Inquisitor's Chamber (X: 1360 Y: -657)
- [ ] **Blood of Lathander** → (backup weapon): Legendary mace from Rosymorn Monastery. Complete the Dawnmaster Crest puzzle (place ceremonial weapons on the altars). **Disarm the trap** in the vault or the entire monastery explodes.
- Confront the Inquisitor — this leads to a major story reveal about the Prism and the Astral Plane.

> **RESPEC REMINDER (Shadowheart at level 7):** Respec to 1 Paladin (Vengeance) → 6 Swords Bard. This gives Heavy Armor proficiency — she can now wear Adamantine Splint or Dwarven Splintmail. Drop all DEX (Gloves of Dexterity handle it). Boost CON.

**End of Act 1 target: Level 6. Party: Shadowheart, Varria, Astarion, Lae'zel.**

<summary>ACT 2 — Levels 6-9</summary>
<div markdown="1">

### Last Light Inn (Level 6)
First stop in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Isobel's ward protects the inn from the curse.

- [ ] **Cloak of Protection** → Varria: Buy from Quartermaster Talli (temp until Cloak of the Weave in Act 3, then → Shadowheart)
- [ ] **Yuan-ti Scale Mail** → Astarion: Buy from Quartermaster Talli (no stealth disadvantage)
- [ ] **Amulet of the Harpers** → Shadowheart: For emergency saves
- **Defend Isobel** when Marcus attacks — if Isobel falls, Last Light's ward drops and everyone there dies. Focus Marcus immediately.
- Meet Jaheira (she leads the Harpers here — she's lost on the dark path after the Nightsong decision)

> **!! CRITICAL: Kill the Strange Ox near Dammon's blacksmith at Last Light Inn.**

- [ ] **Hat of Fire Acuity** → Varria: **BUILD ENABLER.** Generates Arcane Acuity on Fire damage. Varria's build is NOW ONLINE.

### Moonrise Towers — Infiltrate + Rescue Minthara (Level 6-7)
**Go to Moonrise immediately after Last Light.** Follow the road south — get the Moonlantern from the Harper ambush of Kar'niss the drider en route (full shadow curse protection). Infiltrate Moonrise as a True Soul.

**Priority #1 is rescuing Minthara from the prison** so she's in the party for all remaining Act 2 content.

- [ ] **Risky Ring** → Shadowheart: Buy from Araj Oblodra (X: -128 Y: -193)
- [ ] **Spineshudder Amulet** → Varria: Mimic chest near Isobel's old room (X: -171 Y: -195)
- [ ] **Marksmanship Hat** → Astarion: Buy from Roah Moonglow
- [ ] **Dwarven Splintmail** → Shadowheart: Buy from Lann Tarv (heavy armor upgrade). Convince Z'rell for access to his stock.
- [ ] **Halberd of Vigilance** → Shadowheart: Buy from Lann Tarv
- Get **Potion of Everlasting Vigour** from Araj Oblodra → Shadowheart: **+2 STR** (STR now 20). Warning: causes Astarion relationship issues — save first.

### !! Minthara Joins Permanently
Rescue Minthara from Moonrise Towers prison on this first visit. Walk her out on foot (no fast travel). She goes to camp and asks to join.

- **Immediate respec:** Oathbreaker 7 / White Draconic Sorcerer 5 (see [Minthara guide](minthara))
- **Transfer from Lae'zel:** Adamantine Splint Armour, Sword of Justice, Grymskull Helm
- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** on Minthara (21 STR until Gauntlets in Act 3)
- Lae'zel → camp (retired)
- **Minthara now participates in ALL remaining Act 2 content — Reithwin, Gauntlet of Shar, and the Moonrise assault.**

### Shadow-Cursed Lands Exploration (Level 7)
Explore with Minthara in the party. The Moonlantern provides full curse protection.

- [ ] **Ring of Mental Inhibition** → Varria: Locked chest in House in Deep Shadows (X: 76 Y: 40)
- **He Who Was** quest (SE of Last Light): Follow the blood trail from the battlefield to start "Punish the Wicked" — leads to Raven Gloves
- Free **Dolly Thrice** from inside the Moonlantern (if you have one). She dies if you don't free her before Act 3.

### Reithwin Town — Three Bosses (Level 7)
Clear all three to weaken Ketheric. All three can be talked/tricked to death — much safer than fighting them directly:

1. **House of Healing** (Malus Thorm) — Persuade the sisters to operate on him
2. **Tollhouse / Mason's Guild** (Gerringothe Thorm) — Tell her gold means nothing
   - [ ] **Helmet of Arcane Acuity** → Shadowheart: Locked gilded chest in Mason's Guild basement (X: 107 Y: -758). **CORE ITEM.**
3. **Waning Moon** (Thisobald Thorm) — Drink with him until he explodes (pass CON checks)

### Gauntlet of Shar (Level 7-8)
Complete three trials (Soft-Step, Self-Same, Faith-Leap) to collect 4 Umbral Gems. Minthara's Aura of Protection helps the whole party in the Self-Same Trial clone fight.

- [ ] **Callous Glow Ring** → Varria: Opulent chest in Balthazar's area (X: -819 Y: -753)
- [ ] **Killer's Sweetheart** → Minthara: Self-Same Trial room (X: -833 Y: -729)
- **Yurgir the Orthon**: Encounter in the Gauntlet. **Spare him** (convince him to break Raphael's contract) — he fights alongside you against Raphael in the House of Hope later.
- **Silent Library**: Clear the Justiciars guarding it. Solve the book puzzle for Dark Justiciar Half-Plate and Gauntlets. Worth clearing for gear and lore.

> **!! Rescue any Moonrise Towers prisoners BEFORE entering the Shadowfell. The Shadowfell is a point of no return — all Act 1 and Act 2 maps become permanently inaccessible afterward.**

<details>
<summary><strong>!! STORY CHOICE: Shadowheart and the Nightsong (Spoilers)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

At the end of the Gauntlet of Shar, embrace Shar.
- [ ] **Shar's Spear of Evening** → Shadowheart: **CORE ITEM.** +3 piercing, obscured bonuses, Edge of Darkness, blind immunity.
- Shadowheart becomes Dark Justiciar.
- Replace Halberd of Vigilance immediately.
- **WARNING:** Killing the Nightsong causes Last Light Inn's ward to fall. Everyone there dies (Isobel, Harpers, Jaheira). This is expected on the dark path — make sure you've bought everything from Last Light vendors first.

</div>
</details>

### Moonrise Towers Assault → Mind Flayer Colony (Level 8-9)
- Defeat Ketheric Thorm (harder without Nightsong's help — buff up, focus fire, use the terrain)
- Clear the Mind Flayer Colony beneath. Don't skip the Tadpoling Center — illithid powers are strong and free.

**End of Act 2 target: Level 8-9. Party: Shadowheart, Varria, Astarion, Minthara.**

</div>
</details>

#### Mirror of Loss (House of Grief — Shar Temple)

<details>
<summary><strong>!! STORY CHOICE: Murder Tribunal (Level 11, Spoilers)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

Complete "Investigate the Murders." Bring a hand to Candulhallow's Tombstones.
- Kill Inspector Valeria. Accept Bhaal. Become Unholy Assassin.
- [ ] **Bhaalist Armour** → Shadowheart: Buy from Echo of Abazigal. **Aura of Murder = double ALL piercing damage.** Toggle on/off as needed.
- [ ] **Vicious Shortbow** → Minthara: Buy from Echo of Abazigal (same vendor, stat stick).

> **!! Orin now kidnaps your lowest-approval non-romanced companion.** Keep Minthara in your active party at all times to protect her. Despite Orin's threats, there is no actual death timer for the victim.

> Shadowheart's build is now FULLY ONLINE: Shar's Spear + Bhaalist Armour + Arcane Acuity + Band of Mystic Scoundrel = one-shot most encounters.

</div>
</details>

#### House of Hope (Level 11-12)
Access via Helsik at Devil's Fee. **HUGE gear-up for Minthara.**
- Explore the entire house first. Use the Restoration faucet to long rest inside.
- If you spared Yurgir in Act 2, he fights alongside you against Raphael.
- Free Hope before fighting Raphael — she casts Banishment on his allies.
- [ ] **Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength** → Minthara: Archive pedestal. Sets STR to 23. Drop STR elixirs, switch to Elixir of Bloodlust.

Underwater prison. **6-turn timer** (5 on Tactician). Rescue:
- Gondian prisoners (they help at Steel Watch Foundry + final battle allies)
- Duke Ravengard (if alive)
- Omeluum (if alive)

#### Steel Watch Foundry (Level 11-12)
Disable the Steel Watchers. With rescued Gondians, they rebel and fight alongside you — much easier.

Rescue kidnapped companion. Confront Orin in the Temple of Bhaal beneath the city.
- [ ] **Crimson Mischief** → (spare, or give to Astarion if he wants a dagger offhand)
