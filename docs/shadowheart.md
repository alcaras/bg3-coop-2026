## Level-by-Level Progression

### Level 1 -- Bard 1
- **Cantrips:** Friends, Minor Illusion
- **Spells:** Sleep, Healing Word
- Use Sleep to end fights early. Healing Word is a bonus action pickup.

### Level 2 -- Bard 2
- **Features:** Jack of All Trades, Song of Rest
- **Spell:** Thunderwave or Tasha's Hideous Laughter
- Song of Rest = effectively 3 short rests per long rest.

### Level 3 -- Bard 3 (College of Swords)
- **Subclass:** College of Swords
- **Fighting Style:** Irrelevant (you respec later). Pick anything.
- **Flourish:** Slashing Flourish
- **Spell:** Hold Person
- Build identity online. Slashing Flourish cleaves grouped enemies.

### Level 4 -- Bard 4
- **Feat:** Great Weapon Master (aggressive) or ASI +1 STR / +1 STR (safe for Honor Mode)
- **Spell:** Enhance Ability
- Enhance Ability is critical for Honor Mode skill checks. GWM needs 70%+ hit chance to be worth it.

### Level 5 -- Bard 5
- **Features:** Bardic Inspiration recharges on Short Rest
- **Spell:** Glyph of Warding
- Glyph of Warding is the best mid-game spell. Sleep variant for trash, Lightning/Cold for damage.

### Level 6 -- Bard 6
- **Features:** Extra Attack, Countercharm
- **STOP LEVELING BARD.** You now have two attacks per action with Slashing Flourish.

---

### Level 7 -- RESPEC

**This is the most important moment in the build.**

Respec into: **1 Paladin (Oath of Vengeance) -> 6 Swords Bard**

Why:
- Starting as Paladin 1 gives **Heavy Armor proficiency** (Bard start does not).
- You have Gloves of Dexterity by now (Creche Y'llek), so dump DEX to 8.
- Paladin 1 gives **Command** -- the single most important spell in the build.

Post-respec stats: **17 STR (+1 Hag's Hair = 18), 16 CHA, 14+ CON, 8 DEX** (Gloves set DEX to 18).

Respec spell picks (Bard side): Sleep, Healing Word, Hold Person, Enhance Ability, Glyph of Warding, plus your level 6 choice.

### Level 8 -- Paladin 2
- **Features:** Divine Smite, Fighting Style: Defense (+1 AC)
- **BUILD IS NOW ONLINE.** You can Smite on weapon hits. Defense stacks with heavy armor.
- From here forward: Slashing Flourish + Divine Smite is your core damage loop.

---

### Level 9 -- Bard 7
- Continue Bard levels for higher spell slots (which fuel bigger Smites).
- **Spell:** Replace or add a Level 4 spell.

### Level 10 -- Bard 8
- **Feat:** Savage Attacker
- Savage Attacker rerolls ALL damage dice including Divine Smite dice. Massive value on this build.

### Level 11 -- Bard 9
- **Spell:** Hold Monster
- Universal version of Hold Person. Works on everything except undead. Sets up auto-crit Smites.

### Level 12 -- Bard 10
- **Features:** Magical Secrets
- **Spell 1:** Counterspell -- non-negotiable, shuts down enemy casters
- **Spell 2:** Hunger of Hadar -- evil variant pick. Creates obscured area (synergy with Shar's Spear). Replaces Spirit Guardians from good builds.
- **BUILD COMPLETE: 10 Bard / 2 Paladin.**

## Spell Selection

### Always Prepared (Core)
- **Command** (Paladin) -- Command: Approach groups enemies for Slashing Flourish cleave. The build revolves around this spell.
- **Hold Person** -- Sets up auto-crit Divine Smites. Upcast for multiple targets.
- **Hold Monster** (Bard 9) -- Same as Hold Person but works on non-humanoids.
- **Enhance Ability** -- Critical for Honor Mode dialogue/skill checks.
- **Glyph of Warding** -- Best mid-game AoE. Sleep variant trivializes fights.
- **Counterspell** (Magical Secrets) -- No contested reaction slot. Mandatory.
- **Hunger of Hadar** (Magical Secrets, evil) -- Creates obscured zone. Shar's Spear synergy.

### Utility / Flex Slots
- Healing Word (bonus action emergency heal)
- Sleep (early game, later replaced)
- Bless (from Paladin, if no one else has it)

**Act 2:**
Unseen Menace -> Shar's Spear of Evening. Dwarven Splintmail (heavy armor after respec). Helmet of Arcane Acuity. Risky Ring.

**Act 3:**
Band of the Mystic Scoundrel + Bhaalist Armour + Amulet of the Devout + Cloak of Protection (from Visara). Full build online.

---

## Consumables

- **Elixir of Bloodlust** -- Extra action on kill. Default daily elixir.
- **Elixir of Vigilance** -- Use for single-target boss fights where you need to go first.
- **Oil of Accuracy** -- Pre-coat weapon before fights. Offsets GWM penalty.

---

## Late-Game Combat Loop

**Pre-fight:** Oil of Accuracy on weapon. Ensure you have Haste from a caster.

1. **Stack Arcane Acuity.** Hit an obscured enemy (or any enemy) with weapon attacks. Each hit = +2 Acuity stacks from Helmet of Arcane Acuity. Get 6-8 stacks. Do NOT use GWM or Aura of Murder yet. Do not kill the target -- just stack.

2. **Bonus action Command: Approach** (via Band of the Mystic Scoundrel, which lets you cast enchantment spells as a bonus action after a weapon hit). All enemies walk toward you and group up. Move to an obscured position. End turn.

3. **Slashing Flourish + Divine Smite** through the grouped enemies. Use Edge of Darkness (Shar's Spear AoE ability). Reaction Smites on each hit. Enemies melt.

4. **Bosses with Legendary Resistance:** Command: Grovel first (burns a Legendary Resistance charge). Then Hold Monster next turn for auto-crit Smites.

## Key Mechanics

**Damage Inheritance (Piercing):**
All physical damage riders inherit the Piercing damage type from Shar's Spear. Bhaalist Armour's Aura of Murder gives vulnerability to piercing = double ALL physical damage on nearby targets. This is why the build does absurd damage.

**Obscured:**
Hold Shift to check light level. Shar's Spear gives bonuses when you or enemies are obscured. You are immune to blindness from the spear, so you can fight inside Darkness or Hunger of Hadar freely.

**Band of the Mystic Scoundrel:**
After any weapon attack, cast an enchantment or illusion spell as a BONUS ACTION. Command is an enchantment spell. This is the key to the build's action economy -- attack + Command in the same turn.

**Managing GWM:**
Keep hit chance at 70%+ or toggle off All-In. Sources of advantage: Risky Ring (always on), Unseen Menace (on obscured targets), Hold Person (auto-crit = auto-hit), stealth/surprise.

**Divine Smite Priority:**
Smite on crits (auto from Hold Person/Monster), on kills (to proc Bloodlust), or when you are sure the hit will land. Do not waste slots on misses -- Smite triggers after the hit confirms.
